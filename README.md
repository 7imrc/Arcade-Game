### Frogger-style Game

This project involved taking some starter code from Udacity, which contained art assets and a game engine.  I had to then build the code in order to provide a workable game.

## Installing

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open `index.html` inside your browser.

## Game Play

The playing character can be moved around the screen using the &larr, &uarr, &darr, &rarr keys.

In order to complete the game, you need to get the character safely up the screen to the water 5 times.  If you collide with one of the enemy bugs, the player character will be returned to the start position.

Successfully crossing the screen, will result in a congratulations message, before the game will shortly restart.

## Acknowledgements

The Udacity starter code for this project can be found at their [Github page](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game).

The collision engine used in this project was adapted from [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/2D_collision_detection).
